# VALIDATION FIX

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing during the "Validate YAML syntax" step because:

1. The validation script was trying to use `kubectl` for YAML validation, but no Kubernetes cluster was available in the CI environment
2. The script had complex error handling that was causing premature exits due to `set -euo pipefail`
3. Multiple validation functions were returning non-zero exit codes for warnings, which caused the script to fail

## Solution
1. **Replaced kubectl dependency**: Updated the validation script to use `yq` for YAML syntax validation instead of `kubectl dry-run`
2. **Simplified error handling**: Created a new, simpler validation script that properly handles warnings vs errors
3. **Fixed GitHub Actions workflow**: Removed kubectl setup and updated validation steps to use `yq`
4. **Cleaned up trailing whitespace**: Fixed formatting issues in YAML files

## Result
- All YAML files now pass validation
- The script properly distinguishes between errors (syntax issues) and warnings (best practice violations)
- The GitHub Actions workflow will now succeed for valid YAML syntax
- Remaining warnings are for best practices (templates with placeholders, security settings) which are expected for a demo repo

## Files Modified
- `scripts/validate-config.sh` - Complete rewrite for reliability
- `.github/workflows/validate-config.yml` - Removed kubectl dependency
- Fixed trailing whitespace in multiple YAML files
